                        <h2>The Beginning: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h2>
                        <p>
                            Recurrent Neural Networks were developed to handle sequential data by maintaining
                            a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs. Introduced in the
                            1980s, RNNs were revolutionary because they could process variable-length sequences
                            and theoretically remember information from arbitrarily long contexts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, RNNs faced a critical limitation: the vanishing gradient problem. During
                            backpropagation through time, gradients would either explode or vanish, making it
                            nearly impossible to learn long-term dependencies.

                        <h2>The Vanishing Gradient Problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become exponentially small
                            as they propagate backward through many time steps. This means that early time
                            steps receive very little gradient information, making it difficult for the network
                            to learn relationships between distant inputs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Researchers tried various solutions, including gradient clipping and careful
                            initialization, but the fundamental problem remained: standard RNNs struggled
                            with long-term memory.

                        <h2>The LSTM Breakthrough (1997)</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 1997, Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber introduced the Long Short-Term
                            Memory network, which elegantly solved the vanishing gradient problem. The key
                            innovation was the use of a cell state that runs through the entire sequence,
                            with gates that control the flow of information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs can selectively remember or forget information,
                            allowing them to maintain long-term dependencies while avoiding the problems
                            that plagued earlier architectures.

                        <h2>LSTM in the Modern Era</h2>
                        <p>
                            Since their introduction, LSTMs have been widely adopted in various fields.
                            They power speech recognition systems, language translation models, and time
                            series forecasting applications. Variations like GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
                            and attention mechanisms have further extended their capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, LSTMs continue to be a fundamental building block in deep learning,
                            especially in domains where sequence modeling and temporal dependencies are crucial.
